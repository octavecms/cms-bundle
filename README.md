Octave CMS
==========

Octave is a lightweight open source CMS and website development tool.
It is built on top of popular tools you already know and love: [Symfony PHP framework](https://symfony.com/), [Sonata Project](https://sonata-project.org/), and [Doctrine ORM](http://www.doctrine-project.org/).
Octave comes with a set of predefined controllers and reusable features (learn more about them in the [Developer's guide](docs/Developers-guide.md)) to enable seamless integration into any kind of project. 
While the Octave CMS has native website-building components, you are welcome to combine standard Symfony web-application development approach with Octave's.
Using an intuitive drag-and-drop interface to control website structure and page functions makes everyday content management tasks easier.
In other words, such synergy between the systems results in flexibility and simplicity of website development and further content maintenance.

## Key benefits to web site editor:
* drag-and-drop website structure management
* drag-and-drop for building web page out of collection of features 
* media library
* content versions
* customizable user roles

## Key benefits to developer:
* out of the box controllers and editors for creating new website features in a matter of minutes
* adding new features to web pages without writing even a line of code  
* focus on development, not content management 
* start building new features right away - no excess learning required
