Octave CMS
==========

Octave is a lightweight open source CMS and web site development tool.
It is built on top of the tools you already know and love: [Symfony PHP framework](https://symfony.com/), [Sonata Project](https://sonata-project.org/), and [Doctrine ORM](http://www.doctrine-project.org/).
Octave comes with a set of predefined controllers and reusable features (learn more on them in the [Developer's guide](docs/Developers.md)) to enable smooth and fast integration into any kind of project. 
Although, CMS provides it is own components for building web sites it does not limit you in combining standard Symfony web-application development approach with Octave's.
Drag-and-drop control over web site structure and page functions makes everyday content management tasks easier.
In other words, such synergy between the systems results in flexibility and simplicity of web site development and further content maintenance.

## Key benefits to web site editor:
