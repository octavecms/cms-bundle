## Basic concepts

Octave CMS comes with basic page templates and collection of features called blocks.  
Page templates are regular TWIG files. 
Blocks are PHP classes with inclusion of CMS specific methods to respond to CMS requests and your logic for building up a web page. 
Blocks also use TWIG templates. You can modify both page and block templates in the way you usually do - extend them, use variables and control structures.
Content editors drag-and-drop blocks on CMS pages to create a unique set of features for every page.
