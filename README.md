Octave CMS
==========

Octave is a lightweight open source CMS and website development tool.
It is built on top of popular tools you already know and love: [Symfony PHP framework](https://symfony.com/), [Sonata Project](https://sonata-project.org/), and [Doctrine ORM](http://www.doctrine-project.org/).
Octave comes with a set of predefined controllers and reusable features (learn more about them in the [Developer's guide](docs/Developers-guide.md)) to enable seamless integration into any kind of project. 
While Octave CMS has native website-building components, you are welcome to combine standard Symfony web-application development approach with Octave's.
Using an intuitive drag-and-drop interface to control website structure and page functions makes everyday content management tasks easier.
The synergy between the systems results in flexibility and simplicity of website development and further content maintenance.

## Key benefits to website editor:

## Key benefits to developer:

* adding new features to web pages without writing even a line of code  
* focus on development, not content management 
* start building new features right away - no excess learning required
