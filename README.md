Octave CMS
=====

Building web sites on [Symfony framework](https://symfony.com/) never been so easy until now.
Easy to use Octave CMS built on top of tools you already know and love: [Symfony PHP framework](https://symfony.com/), [Sonata Project](https://sonata-project.org/), and [Doctrine ORM](http://www.doctrine-project.org/).

## CMS at a Glance

Octave CMS is both content management and web site development tool. 
It's quite simple tool both content editors and developers can benefit on. 
The tool gives developers freedom to combine standard Symfony framework development approach 
by handling web site page rendering in controllers with management of web site structure with the help of CMS.
Drag-and-drop editors allow to change visual representation of a page and web site tree in a seconds.

### CMS benefits to web site editor:
* drag-ann-drop web site structure management
* drag-and-drop for building web page out of collection of features (blocks)
* media library
* content versions
* access rights

### CMS benefits to developer:
* out of the box controllers and editors for creating new web site features in a few minutes
* adding new features to a web site pages without writing even a line of code  
* focus on development, not content management 
* start building new features right away - no excess learning required
